For raw project instructions see: http://syllabus.africacode.net/projects/data-science-specific/data-visualisation/linux-evolution/

## Project Setup
 
### 1. Environment Setup:
In the instructions below, information is provided to install the necessary tools needed to run the notebook and its dependencies on any capable machine:
- Set up Python on your computer. Refer to: [GETTING SET UP TO WRITE PYTHON ON YOUR COMPUTER](http://syllabus.africacode.net/environment-setup/python-on-computer/index.html).
- Configure Git on your system. Follow the instructions in: [GETTING GIT SET UP](http://syllabus.africacode.net/environment-setup/git/).
- Additional resources: [MORE ABOUT GIT](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git).
- To avoid reading and following the above-mentioned instructions on setting up an environment for the project, command prompts can be used in Windows Terminal or Command Prompt as follows:
  1. Create a new virtual environment to run the tests in by using the following command in the terminal window - `python -m venv <virtual_environment_name>`
  2. Activate the new virtual environment that you just created using the following command - `<virtual_environment_name>\Scripts\activate`
  3. Open all the cloned and downloaded folders associated with the Evolution of Linux Visualisation project in the activated virtual environment

### 2. Cloning the Repository:
In the instructions below, information is provided to clone the repository of the project. Cloning the repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data associated with the GitHub.com uploads:
- To clone the project repository, check [CLONING THE REPOSITORY](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#creating-remote-repositories) for instructions.
- Link to repository - https://github.com/Umuzi-org/Oageng-Moche-245-evolution-of-linux-visualisation-python
- To avoid reading and following the above-mentioned instructions on cloning the project's repository, a command prompt can used in Windows Terminal or Command Prompt as follows - `git clone https://github.com/Umuzi-org/Oageng-Moche-245-evolution-of-linux-visualisation-python.git`

### 3. Installing Required Python Packages:
Once the repository has been cloned and the virtual environment has been set up:
1. Open the notebook file in a text editor for code
2. In the Windows Terminal of the file, type in the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the modules required to run the files for the project

## Running the Linux Visualisation:
- After installing the required packages, you should be able to run the notebook and its dependencies on your machine.

### 4. Deactivating environment setup:
Once the necessary tasks have been completed, deactivate the virtual environment that was set up to run the tasks by typing
the following command in the Windows Terminal or Command Prompt - `deactivate`
